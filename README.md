# how-to-nurish-yourself

I think the fundamental notion of nurishment is missing from our culture.  You see signs of this across the internet - we are moving increasing
to small tidbits of information while working in the context of larger projects.  Barely keeping up our knowledge, perspective, or understanding.

We need to move towards a digital conversation where intellectual nurishment is center stage.  Such a set of conversations see the internet
as a library instead of the internet as tv.  Which it has certainly now become.  

I believe in order to achieve this we need to start thinking about what helps us fill intellectually fullfiled and strive towards that.
